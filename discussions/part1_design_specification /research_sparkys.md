# Theme Park Webpage review

# Site: [Sparky’s](https://ksa.sparkysme.com/en)
# Overview:

The site’s main page is divided into seven sections. Header, slide show, packages, “Sparkys world”, Attractions, Events, and finally a footer.
Both the header and footer are for navigation. The difference is that the footer is an expanded navigation covering the site map.

# Website Structure
Home page serves as the main front for all information required by customers; Pricing, Packages, & Events. While most of the information is on the home page, the themepark location can be found in a seperate page under "Location & Timing". 



# Stakeholders

The site is primarily targeted towards customers.
Customers can create accounts and submit forums such as “Book your Trip” Forum which is handled by provider.
Creating accounts allows customers to see records of purchases and “Sparkys” pre-paid cards linked to their account.

# Insights

- Allowing user to create account and book/buy tickets is great
- Site is missing images or videos of major park attractions & it’s not location specific
- Simple access to most of the site with little complications
- Most of the pages lack functionality or clear purpose
